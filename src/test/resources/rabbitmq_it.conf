# According to rabbitMQ docs: Values lower than one minute are not supported
# Whether the timeout should be enforced is evaluated periodically, at one minute intervals
# (https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout)
# Actually, timeouts less than a minute are applied as expected contrary to the documentation (RabbitMQ 3.12.7).
# Using small timeouts to reduce testing time
